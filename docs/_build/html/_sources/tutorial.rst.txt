Tutorial
========

This tutorial goes through each and every step of the process to 
assemble and operate a water quality sensor. No experience is
required. We will cover everything from buying the required parts
to downloading code to the designated platform.

**Dependencies:**

For this project there are two classes of dependencies. The hardware
and the software. We will start with the hardware since it requires 
the purchase of and delivery of equipment. A link to a list of all required 
dependencies is on the home page.
